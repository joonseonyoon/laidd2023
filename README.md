## Overview

This repository provides training methods for docked molecules and docking score. With the trained model, one can virtually screen the chemical compounds with the high binding affinity. 
Prior to train the model, one have to dock 0.5M compounds to the target protein structure to collect the docking score. Please refer to Autodock for docking practice (https://autodock.scripps.edu/).
